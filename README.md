# Github Searcher 🔎

## About The Project

This is an application where you can search for my Github repositories.

## Built with 🚀

* [React](https://reactjs.org) as a javascript library.
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as CSS framework.
* [Primer](https://primer.style/) as a component library 

## Getting Started ⚙️

- Clone this repo:
  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:mireiasuefra/github-search.git
  ```

- Install dependencies
  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

- Run it
  ```shell
  npm start
  ```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Decisions 📚

As we were given the freedom to rely on any plugin/module to help us in the task, I have relied on Primer library from Github. I didn't want to make all the components with this library but it helped me to make the header and add the links according to the Github style guide.


## Improvements 📝

- I would have liked to put Typescript, right now I have started to studying it, so when I have more knowledge it will be added.

- Add some tests.

- Add functionality to switch the Github user. At the moment it only uses my user.

- Add more filters: Some filters such as by technology, date, etc. could be added.

- Deploy the app in Heroku. It is currently deployed on Github pages.
